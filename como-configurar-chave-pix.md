## Pix configuration

To use the PIX in SMais application, it is necessary you have at least one key configured. The PIX key can be:

- Email address.
- Phone number.
- Brazilian document number (CPF).
- Random key generated by the system.

In the following guide, you can check out the step-by-step to configure a PIX key.

### How to configure the Pix key

1. In the SMais app, go to **Pix** section.
3. Tap **Configure key**.
4. From the **Key configuration**, select the key option and follow the instructions of the next steps.
- **CPF:**  At the bottom to complete the configuration, tap **Confirm**. 
 
   *NOTE*: The **CPF** option does not extend the process with the sending of code because the application retrieves document number from your account registration.
   
- **Email or phone number:** At the bottom, tap **Send code** to receive a 6-digit code via SMS or e-mail. To complete the configuration, enter the 6-digit code and tap **Confirm**.
- **Random key**: At the bottom, tap **Generate key**. The app will generate a key with 6 characters with letters, numbers and special characters. To complete the configuration, tap **Confirm**. 



When the process completes, you can use the configured key to transfer the funds.

*NOTE:* The SMais application only configure Pix key values not used yet in any payment institution. If the key already exist, the application does not complete the process and shows the message "Pix key value is already used in other payment institution".
