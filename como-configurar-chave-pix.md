### Benefits

The Pix has many benefits to the final customer, legal or individual, that are:

- Full-time availability.
- Transfer the funds in seconds.
- Tranfer funds from legal enitity to the individual person. Vice-versa. 
- No fees for individual person and low fee for legal entities.

The difference from Pix to the others payments instruments such as TED and DOC is the speediness and availability. For example, if you choose to do a TED at 10PM of a Monday, the fund transferred will be available only on Thuesday at 7AM. In case of Pix, if you choose to send an amount to someone, the amount will be available after 5 seconds maximum.

## Management

To use the PIX in SMais application, it is necessary you have at least one key configured. The PIX key can be:

- Email address.
- Phone number.
- Brazilian document number (CPF).
- Random key generated by the system.

In the following guide, you can check out the step-by-step to configure a PIX key.

### Pix key registration

1. In the SMais app, go to **Pix** section.
3. Tap **Configure key**.
4. From the **Key configuration**, select the key option and follow the instructions of the next steps.
- **CPF:**  At the bottom to complete the registration, tap **Confirm**. 
 
   *NOTE*: The **CPF** option does not extend the process with the sending of code because the application retrieves document number from your account information.
   
- **Email or phone number:** At the bottom, tap **Send code** to receive a 6-digit code via SMS or e-mail. To complete the configuration, enter the 6-digit code and tap **Confirm**.
- **Random key**: At the bottom, tap **Generate key**. The app will generate a key with 6 characters with letters, numbers and special characters. To complete the registration, tap **Confirm**. 



When the process completes, you can use the configured key to transfer the funds.

*NOTE:* The SMais application only configure Pix key values not used yet in any payment service. If the key already exists, the application does not complete the process and shows the message "Pix key value is already used in other payment institution".
